# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Phase 1 of the Renum API, which focuses on core authentication functionality and team management capabilities. The API will serve as the backend for the Renum platform, integrating with Supabase for authentication and the existing Suna Backend for agent execution. This phase establishes the foundational endpoints and infrastructure needed to support user authentication, team creation and management, and basic health monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API to provide health check endpoints, so that I can monitor the system status and ensure all services are operational.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /health THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status with basic health information including status, version, and timestamp
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /health/services THEN the system SHALL return detailed health status for database, suna_backend, and websocket services with latency metrics
3. IF any critical service is unavailable THEN the health check SHALL return appropriate status indicators and error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with the system using my email and password, so that I can access protected resources and manage my teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /api/v1/auth/login with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL return an access token, token type, expiration time, and user information
2. WHEN a POST request is made to /api/v1/auth/login with invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a 401 status with appropriate error message
3. WHEN a POST request is made to /api/v1/auth/refresh with a valid refresh token THEN the system SHALL return a new access token with expiration time
4. IF the refresh token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return a 401 status with appropriate error message
5. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL integrate with Supabase for user verification and token management

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to create and manage teams, so that I can organize agents into workflows for automated task execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/v1/teams THEN the system SHALL return a paginated list of teams with basic information including id, name, description, workflow_type, agents_count, and status
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/v1/teams with query parameters THEN the system SHALL support pagination (page, limit) and search filtering
3. WHEN a POST request is made to /api/v1/teams with valid team data THEN the system SHALL create a new team and return the created team with generated id and timestamps
4. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/v1/teams/{team_id} THEN the system SHALL return detailed team information including full agent configurations and relationships
5. WHEN a PUT request is made to /api/v1/teams/{team_id} with valid data THEN the system SHALL update the team and return the updated information
6. WHEN a DELETE request is made to /api/v1/teams/{team_id} THEN the system SHALL remove the team and return 204 No Content status
7. IF a team operation is attempted on a non-existent team THEN the system SHALL return 404 status with appropriate error message
8. WHEN team data includes agents THEN the system SHALL validate agent configurations and maintain proper workflow ordering

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to integrate with external services, so that the platform can leverage existing authentication and agent execution capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL establish connections to Supabase for authentication and user management
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL establish connections to Suna Backend for agent operations and execution
3. WHEN external service calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
4. IF external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation and appropriate error responses
5. WHEN integrating with Suna Backend THEN the system SHALL use the configured API URL (http://157.180.39.41:8000/api) and WebSocket URL
6. WHEN making requests to external services THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers and API keys

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API to follow proper architectural patterns, so that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the API THEN the system SHALL follow the proposed directory structure with core, domain, usecases, infra, api, and schemas layers
2. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL use Pydantic schemas for request/response validation and serialization
3. WHEN implementing business logic THEN the system SHALL separate concerns between API layer, use cases, and infrastructure
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
5. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper logging using structured logging for debugging and monitoring
6. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL support environment-based configuration for different deployment environments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the API to provide secure access control, so that I can only access and modify my own teams and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL require valid JWT authentication tokens
2. WHEN a user accesses team resources THEN the system SHALL verify the user owns or has access to the requested team
3. WHEN JWT tokens expire THEN the system SHALL return 401 status and require token refresh
4. WHEN invalid or malformed tokens are provided THEN the system SHALL return 401 status with appropriate error message
5. WHEN implementing authorization THEN the system SHALL use middleware to validate tokens on protected routes
6. WHEN user context is needed THEN the system SHALL extract user information from validated JWT tokens

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API to have comprehensive error handling, so that clients receive meaningful error messages and the system remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 422 status with detailed field-level error information
2. WHEN resource not found errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 404 status with clear error messages
3. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 401 status with appropriate error descriptions
4. WHEN authorization errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 403 status with access denied messages
5. WHEN internal server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 500 status with generic error message and log detailed error information
6. WHEN external service errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts, connection errors, and service unavailability gracefully
7. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL include request context, user information, and stack traces for debugging
